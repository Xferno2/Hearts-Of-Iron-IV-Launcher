# Hearts-Of-Iron-IV-Launcher

This project is completly bare bones. Only enabling and disabling mods work right now.

## How to use the launcher

Simply compile the project and copy from debug the exe and new newtonsoft.json dll to the HOI4 directory. Open once HOI4 from steam to update the mods list. You can now open the `HOIIV Launcher.exe` and start the game.
