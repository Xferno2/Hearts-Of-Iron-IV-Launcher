# Hearts of Iron IV Launcher

This project is completly bare bones and pure spaghetti code. It's something I made up fast so I can play the game without problems created by the Paradox Launcher V2. I might polish the launcher in the future but until then feel free to fork this and modify the project to your liking.

## How to use the launcher

Simply compile the project and copy from `Debug` folder everything into the Hearts of Iron IV root folder. You will have to run the steam launcher or pdx launcher once to generate mods files. After that you can open `Hoi4 Launcher.exe` and you are good to go.
