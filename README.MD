#Hearts-Of-Iron-IV-Launcher
This project is completly bare bones. Only enabling and disabling mods work right now.

#How to use the launcher
Simply compile the project and copy from debug the exe and new newtonsoft.json dll. Open once Hearts of Iron IV from steam to update the mods list. You can now open the `HOIIV Launcher.exe` and start the game.
